## Binary Search Tree

#### Terms
a binary search tree - T
No. of nodes in a tree - N
height of a tree - h : the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. 
key of a node - .key : comparable value, usually numbers
left child of a node - .left
right child of a node - .right
parent of a node - .p

#### Property
    1. 1 node tree has h == 0
    2. If T is balanced then h == log(N)
    3. Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y.key   x:key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y:key   x:key.

#### Performance
